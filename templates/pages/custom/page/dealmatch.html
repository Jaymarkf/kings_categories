<h1><span style="color: #d22229;">Deal Match Guarantee</span></h1>
<hr>
<p>King's Great Buys Plus wants you to avail your desired product without worrying about the price. If you find a lower price advertised by a local retail competitor for a similar brand and model prior to your purchase or up to 30 days after, we will match that deal.</p>
<p>Simply bring a copy of the ad or deal of the local competitor to a King's Great Buys Plus store while it is still in effect. Once validated and verified, we will match the competitor's deal. We can also match our own deals during price drops and special offers from the product's manufacturer, given that it is within the specified time frame.</p>
<p>However, the deal match guarantee does not apply to the following:</p>
<p>- Offers that include financing and bundling of items<br>- Pricing errors and mail-in offers<br>- Free, limited-quantity, out-of-stock, clearance, refurbished, and special sale or holiday items<br><img src="https://www.kingsgreatbuys.com/uploads/files/7494.flim.v138.bffffff.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="263" height="120"></p>
<p class="section-header"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEAL MATCH FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: Who is considered a local retail competitor?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: Acceptable local retail competitors are authorized stores located in the same market area as your local King's Great Buys Plus store.</em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: What is considered "proof" of deal?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: For already purchased items, proofs of deal include the King's Great Buys Plus original and official receipt and the local competitor's current ad, sales receipt, work sheet or quote. For deal matching, we reserve the right to contact the competitor’s store for deal verification and checking of the item’s availability.</em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: How do you handle a deal match if the King's Great Buys Plus deal includes a promotional offer such as a free gift card or rebate?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: The King's Great Buys Plus net purchase deal is calculated by deducting the value of all instant and mail-in discounts such as rebates, free offers and promotional gift cards. Existing rebates and free offers associated with a product purchased at King's Great Buys Plus will not apply if a deal match is executed.</em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: How do you handle a deal match for instant gift cards included in a purchase?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: The value of an instant gift card with purchase will be considered when calculating a deal match. If the combined value of a competitor's product and instant gift card is lower than the combined value of King’s Great Buys Plus'&nbsp;product deal and instant gift card, King's Great Buys Plus will match either the deal or the instant gift card value, depending on the offer.</em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: How do you handle a deal match for a competitor’s deal with rebate and promotional offer inclusions?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: We deduct the value of instant discounts such as instant rebates from the total amount of purchase to get the competitor's net purchase deal. Mail-in rebates and other deferred savings are not included in the deductions.</em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: What if the local competitor does not have the item in stock or has limited quantities of the product?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: Sometimes, a retailer will advertise a very low deal for a product but have only limited quantities in stock. Out-of-stock or items with limited quantities are not eligible for deal matching. Likewise, if King's Great Buys Plus has a product that is advertised as being limited in quantity it will not be eligible for deal matching.</em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: Are King’s Great Buys Plus services eligible for deal matching?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: Due to differences in performance of services and types of service offered, deal matching is not applicable to services (i.e. deliver/installation, warranties, etc.)<br></em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: Can I have my deal match request processed over the phone or online?</strong></p>
<p><em><em>A: Because of the nature of deal matching, we are unable to allow customers to deal match online or over the telephone. In order to take advantage of this guarantee, you must put your order in at a physical King's Great Buys Plus store.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.kingsgreatbuys.com/stores"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Click here</span></span></span></a><span style="color: #d22229;"><span style="color: #d22229;">&nbsp;</span></span>to locate one near you.</em></em></p>
<p class="font-bold"><strong>Q: Are Internet-only retailer deals eligible for King’s Great Buys Plus deal matching?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: King's Great Buys Plus does not match the deals of Internet-only retailers or the online-only offers of our local retail competitors. If you find a local retail competitor honoring its own online deals, we'll match their deal. Eligible items must be the same brand and model, in the same condition and currently in stock at the local retail competitor's store.</em></p>
