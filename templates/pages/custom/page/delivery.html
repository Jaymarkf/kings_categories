                <h3>Always take the following measurements:</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>
                    <a>All door and hallway sizes, both width and height.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a>If the furniture is going up or downstairs, measure the diagonal distance between the ceiling and the stairs.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a>Keep in mind that this measurement needs to be 4 or more inches greater than the diagonal measurement of the piece.</a>

                <h3>The most common pieces that do not fit are:</h3>
                
            <h6>Large headboards going upstairs.</h6>
            <p>Because the headboard is much smaller than the dresser, many people assume it will fit. However, many headboards are the tallest pieces going into a bedroom.</p>
            <h6>Deep sofas.</h6>
            <p>Sofas that are deeper in size can be tricky to get around corners/turns. The best way to ensure a sofa will fit is to measure the diagonal distance from the head of the sofa to the bottom of the front leg. This diagonal distance will tell you if the piece can fit through a door or hallway.</p>
            <h6>Heavy merchandise that needs to be turned at the end of a hallway.</h6>
            <p>The heavier a piece of furniture is, the less maneuverable it is. Due to hallway constraints, the delivery team needs to put these pieces on their ends to get around corners. The ceiling needs to be higher than the diagonal measurement of the piece.</p>
